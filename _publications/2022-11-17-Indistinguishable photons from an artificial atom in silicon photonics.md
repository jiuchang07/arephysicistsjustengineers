excerpt: 'Silicon is the ideal material for building electronic and photonic circuits at scale. Spin qubits and integrated photonic quantum technologies in silicon offer a promising path to scaling by leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing and integration capabilities. However, the lack of deterministic quantum light sources, two-photon gates, and spin-photon interfaces in silicon poses a major challenge to scalability. In this work, we show a new type of indistinguishable photon source in silicon photonics based on an artificial atom. We show that a G center in a silicon waveguide can generate high-purity telecom-band single photons. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy and time-delayed two-photon interference to demonstrate the indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a G center in a silicon waveguide. Our results show that artificial atoms in silicon photonics can source highly coherent single photons suitable for photonic quantum networks and processors.'
