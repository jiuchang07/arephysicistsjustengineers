My name is Jiu Chang. I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology. Currently, I am studying integrated optics and metasurfaces with [Professor Ali Adibi](https://sites.gatech.edu/ece-prg/people/adibi/). We aspire to build high-sensitivity room-temperature magnetometry from vapor cells deploying metalens-based pump and probe beams.

Quantum information science
======
Many who work in quantum computing define the current state as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Their goal is quantum advantage - to build quantum computers that exceed the performance of classical computers in certain tasks. As the overly-cited Richard Feynman said in 1982, "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical." Theorists are eager to demonstrate that it can run optimization algorithms at a much higher speed than classical computers, therefore lead the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence.

I believe we are in a more urgent need for engineering than physics to achieve quantum advantage. We must improve the scalability, controllability for initialization and gate operations, coherence times, nondemolition measurements and quantum communication (cf. DiVincenzo's criteria). Some of these have been shown as proof-of-concept on many platforms, including but not limited to superconducting qubits, trapped ions and neutral atoms, solid-state qubits like quantum dots and color centers, photonic qubits, and topological qubits. However, we need highly sophiticated systems with low noise and high precision, which may use some help from the engineers. Hence, here I am, in an Electrical and Computer Engineering lab as a Physics Ph.D. student.
